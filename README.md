# Plant-Seed-Classification
Plant Seed Classification
# Objective:
Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling? Given an image
differentiate between different plant types.
Tthis dataset gives you an opportunity to experiment with different image
recognition techniques, as well to provide a place to cross-pollenate ideas.
# Context:
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better
stewardship of the environment.
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with
University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset
containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12
species at several growth stages.
# Data Description:
You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant
seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its
unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the
competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's
species from a photo. 
*The list of species is as follows:*
 Black-grass
 Charlock
 Cleavers
 Common Chickweed
 Common wheat
 Fat Hen
 Loose Silky-bent
 Maize
 Scentless Mayweed
 Shepherds Purse
 Small-flowered Cranesbill
 Sugar beet
